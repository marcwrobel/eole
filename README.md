Eole is a repository that gather data about end-of-life dates and support lifecycles of various products. The project
is named after [Ã‰ole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolus_(son_of_Hippotes)), the French name of the ruler of the winds
in Greek mythology.

## History

This project was started as a proof of concept after realizing the enormous amount of manual work required to maintain
the excellent website [Endoflife.date](https://github.com/endoflife-date/endoflife.date). What if there was a way to
automate most of the updates ?
