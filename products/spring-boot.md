> [Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) helps you to create Spring-powered, production-grade
> applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new
> and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

See [here](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot#support) for more details about support roadmap.

- Spring Boot 3.x requires **at least a Java 17 runtime**
- Spring Boot 2.7.5 (and therefore the latest Spring Framework 5.3.23) supports Java 19 while also remaining compatible
  with Java 11 and 8.
